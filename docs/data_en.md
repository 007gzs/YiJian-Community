<font style="color: gray">Business compliance is related to specific business scenarios such as healthcare, government affairs, and finance. Compared with the other three types of risks, it is less universal and will not be explained in detail here.</font>

# Data Samples

To help everyone quickly get started with the full-process automated evaluation capabilities of the YiJian-Community, we sampled a tiny number of low-risk questions from the open source dataset and sent each question to ten open source large models (namely [GOAT-AI/GOAT-7B-Community](https://huggingface.co/GOAT-AI/GOAT-7B-Community), [microsoft/Orca-2-7b](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Orca-2-7b), [stabilityai/StableBeluga-7B](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/StableBeluga-7B), [migtissera/SynthIA-7B-v1.3](https://huggingface.co/migtissera/SynthIA-7B-v1.3), [PygmalionAI/pygmalion-2-7b](https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI/pygmalion-2-7b), [Local-Novel-LLM-project/Ninja-v1-NSFW-128k](https://huggingface.co/Local-Novel-LLM-project/Ninja-v1-NSFW-128k), [KoboldAI/OPT-13B-Nerybus-Mix](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/OPT-13B-Nerybus-Mix), [microsoft/Orca-2-13b](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Orca-2-13b), [stabilityai/StableBeluga-13B](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/StableBeluga-13B), [facebook/opt-13b](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-13b)) to get responses and then form evaluation data samples [samples_50_zh.jsonl](../yijian_community/data/samples_50_zh.jsonl). These models have been preliminarily tested and are easier to generate risk responses.

<font style="color: gray">The open sourced large models we used to obtain risk responses have insufficient basic capabilities, and sometimes may generate responses that are incoherent or repetitive.</font>

The format of each evaluation data is as follows:

```json
{
    "prompt_text": "risky quesion",
    "source": "the source of the risky quesion",
    "references": [
    {
        "text": "the response generated by response_model for prompt_text",
        "response_model": "the name of the model that generates text",
        "label": "Whether text is risky, 1 means yes and 0 means no "
    },
    {
        "text": "",
        "response_model": "",
        "label": ""
    },
    ···
    ]
}
```

<font style="color: gray">The references field is mainly used for automated evaluation methods based on similarity. If other evaluation schemes are used, it can be omitted.</font>

# More evaluation dataset

A large amount of safety evaluation data (such as [SafetyPrompts.com](https://safetyprompts.com/)) has been open sourced, and you can try different data to initiate evaluations. If you find problems with the YiJian-Community during the evaluation process, we welcome and appreciate your feedback!
